This is a text file which has a summary of the models I am considering. 
- Kl3m 
    - Low context window, input was truncated
    - Was completing the document instead of classifying the document
    - It is a causal LM
- Mistral
    - LLMs have been trained on millions of documents and have internal knowledge of what contracts, invoices, resumes, etc. look like. You’re leveraging that directly — no training required.
    - If you want to determine the type of a document based on its text, but don’t have predefined labels or examples, you can approach this with a prompt-based zero-shot strategy using an LLM (Large Language Model). This avoids clustering and avoids needing labeled data.
    - Trade-off of memory vs cost
    - Took too long to generate a response
